# Baghchal

This is a simple board game that is played in Nepal. 

I had ported the code to html/js around 2007 (from the original code in QBASIC that was written in high school even a few years before).

I have decided to export this code to github from google code (code.google.com/p/baghchal-online), which has been discontinued.
